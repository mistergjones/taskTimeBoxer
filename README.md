## General info

This application is to enable the user to add/delete notes and commence a countdown timer to help time-box the outcome.

From a developer's point of view, it was to further explore and understand how to implement a React app with the use of hooks (i.e. setState / useEffect) with an interval countdown timer.

## MVP

The following were the key requirements in meeting the MVP/POC.

-   a user can add a number of notes / tasks they would like to keep track of.
-   a user can delete a note at any time.
-   a user can commence 60 minute countdown timer on the task of interest.
-   a user can PAUSE and RESET the countdown timer if need be.

## Future Functionality

Future functionality can incorporate the following:

-   Either implement session persistence to allow saving or implement a database feature.
-   Augment the application to mimick a Kanban board and allow the user drag/drop each note to headings such as: "Backlog", "In-progress" and "Done".
-   A user can define a custom countdown timer duration.
